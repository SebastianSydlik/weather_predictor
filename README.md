# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Predictor

This repository contains the **Capstone Project** for the **Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025**.

## üß© Problem Statement

Weather prediction is a complex and non-trivial task. Traditional methods rely on physical models that calculate how atmospheric conditions propagate into neighboring regions. These models are generally reliable for **short-term forecasts** (1‚Äì3 days), but accuracy significantly decreases for longer timeframes.

Recent advances in **Artificial Intelligence**, especially **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** like **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, have shown promise in extending the reliability of weather forecasting. However, using such models effectively requires a **clean, well-maintained, and up-to-date database** of historical weather data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dataset Creation & Technologies Used

This project focuses on creating such a dataset and setting up the corresponding **data pipeline** for the city of **Wuppertal, Germany**. Weather data is sourced from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), which provides a **free API** for historical weather data.
